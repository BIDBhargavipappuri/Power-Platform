# **Agenda: Power Platform Series**

To demonstrate my expertise in the Power Platform, I created a series of videos showcasing the solutions I have built. Since the Power Platform integrates closely with Azure DevOps, these videos highlight my hands‑on work and provide direct URLs for viewers to explore the implementations in detail.


# Copilot Studio - Built Chatbots.

In Microsoft Copilot Studio, agents are used to build chatbots with low or minimal code. Based on the requirement, you can also add complex logic by integrating Power Platform tools. Chatbots can respond to user questions or messages, use topics or prompts, handle FAQs, and provide information.


Agents - Understands complex natural language, Makes Decisions, Maintain memory , can perform tasks.


# AI Builder + Power Automate (Automated Cloud Flow)
By using AI builder we can create custom AI models that meets our business needs. 
-Extracting the data from lots of invoice copies take time , this can be simplified using AI models.
-Here I will explain how to train model to extract the data from invoice copies and by using the  power Automate flow the invoice extraction of data and storing the data in database can be automated.

We do this in 5 Steps

-Use an AI model -First we will choose the  available AI models in power platform.
-Tarin and Publish the model-  we will train the model with 5 documents and publish.
-Create a flow- Using Automated cloud flow we are creating flow
-use the AI model Trained - with the help of  AI model name trained we will specify the model to use.
-store the data in the Database- Store the data in Microsoft dataverse which is part of power platform.

Note- Use documents/PDF's of same format for better results and its best practice as well.

# PowerApps - Canvas APP

-I built a Canvas App using Microsoft Dataverse as the backend. The main purpose of the app is to let users fill in a form and save their information directly into the Dataverse table.

-Canvas app- Canvas APP is great option when you need a lot of flexibility in both design and user experience.Canvas apps we start with blank canvas ,it can be low code, but the option is there to add code when you need more complex configurations and calculations. 

-In my app, I used  Power Apps features like collections, submit buttons, edit forms, and a gallery to display the data. Together, these pieces allow users to enter new records or update existing ones easily.

# PowerApps - Model Driven  APP

- A model‑driven app is an application built on top of Dataverse, where the data model (tables, relationships, business rules, and processes) drives the app’s behavior.
- Instead of designing screens manually, the app automatically generates rich UI experiences based on the underlying data structure.
- Because the app is model‑driven, the Dataverse tables act as the database, and the forms, views, dashboards, and business logic are all tied to that data model.
- It is strongly recommended to build your model‑driven apps inside a solution.
- A solution is a container that can include:
- Dataverse tables,Columns and relationshipsForms and views,Model‑driven apps,Canvas apps,Power Automate flows,Security roles,Site maps,Environment variables and other components
- By building your app inside a solution you can easily move it to other environments or preserve a copy in your source control repository.
